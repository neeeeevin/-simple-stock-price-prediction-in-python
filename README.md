Predictive Analytics for Stock Prices using Machine Learning


# Stock Price Prediction

## Description
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict stock prices using historical data. The model leverages Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), to perform time series forecasting. The project includes data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## Features
- **Data Collection**: Automatically fetch historical stock price data using the `yfinance` library.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Normalize and preprocess data to prepare it for model training.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create sequences of data to be used as input features for the LSTM model.
- **Model Training**: Train an LSTM model to predict future stock prices based on historical data.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model performance on test data.
- **Visualization**: Plot actual vs. predicted stock prices for visual comparison.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Main programming language.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for data preprocessing and model evaluation.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Deep learning framework used to build and train the LSTM model.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Libraries for data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For exploratory data analysis and prototyping.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock_price_prediction.git
    cd stock_price_prediction
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python stock_price_prediction.py
    ```

## Usage
1. Ensure the virtual environment is activated.
2. Run the script to fetch data, train the model, and visualize predictions:
    ```bash
    python stock_price_prediction.py
    ```
